# Food-Craft-Hub
Food craft Hub is a meal based application that enables one to get a list of categories of the meals available,
and also show a random meal, and when clicked it displays more about the random meal, including:
* Category 
* the area the food is was brought about
* recipe
## Project Description 
> This project is based on communicating with an external server that is the API and getting 
a promise from the Get request either rejected or the information specified on the request.
> After getting a promise either the request was succesfull or *NOT* we display the information 
on the DOM which is dom manipulation.
> After displaying the infomation on the DOM we add interactivity to the elemets.
